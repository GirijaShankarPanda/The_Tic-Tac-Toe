# `The Tic-Tac-Toe` :
### A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game project using Jupyter Notebook in Python.

</br>

>## Project Description:

  ***This project `The Tic-Tac-Toe` is a game for two players. One player plays X and the other plays O. The players take turns placing their marks on a grid of three-by-three cells. If a given player gets three marks in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, then that player wins the game. The game will be tied if no one gets three in a row by the time all the cells are marked.***

</br>

>## Steps:

- ***Step-1 :*** *Write a function that can print out a board. Set up your board as a list, where each index 1-9 corresponds with a number on a number pad, so you get a 3 by 3 board representation.*
  
- ***Step-2 :*** *Write a function that can take in a player input and assign their marker as 'X' or 'O'. Think about using while loops to continually ask until you get a correct answer.*
- ***Step-3 :*** *Write a function that takes in the board list object, a marker ('X' or 'O'), and a desired position (number 1-9) and assigns it to the board.*
- ***Step-4 :*** *Write a function that takes in a board and checks to see if someone has won.*
- ***Step-5 :*** *Write a function that uses the random module to randomly decide which player goes first. You may want to lookup random.randint() Return a string of which player went first.*
- ***Step-6 :*** *Write a function that returns a boolean indicating whether a space on the board is freely available.*
- ***Step-7 :*** *Write a function that checks if the board is full and returns a boolean value. True if full, False otherwise.*
- ***Step-8 :*** *Write a function that asks for a player's next position (as a number 1-9) and then uses the function from step 6 to check if its a free position. If it is, then return the position for later use.*
- ***Step-9 :*** *Write a function that asks the player if they want to play again and returns a boolean True if they do want to play again.*
- ***Step-10 (Final Step) :*** *Use while loops to write a code by putting together the functions that you've already made to run the game!*
